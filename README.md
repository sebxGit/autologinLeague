Autofills login form in league client through terminal. Available on Windows through an app and on Mac with Python installed. Contact sebx on discord if help is needed.

The application allows the user to easily navigate between different accounts through a terminal. All it requires is the user to insert their login info in a txt
file and type either the ingame name or number of the account in the list. E.g. "YoneNameIt" or "1". 

Then, the app will open the league client, type the info in and press enter for you.
