# autologinLeague
Autofills login form in league client through terminal. Available on windows and mac. Contact Sebx#1520 if help needed, business inquiries or duo (d1 S11).

The application allows the user to easily navigate between different accounts through a terminal. All it requires is the user to insert their login info in a txt
file and type either the ingame name or number of the account in the list. E.g. "YoneNameIt" or "1". 

Then, the app will open the league client, type the info in and press enter for you. 

It never has been easier for you to change between multiple accounts.
